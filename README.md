# Python_Analysis
## Sample Analysis and Virtualization python projects 
### Data Analysis Steps:
Data is an important source for a business growth and it is very important to know how to sort these data; so that it helps to provide a good insight for solving certain problems.This analysis process of data helps to obtain something more from the given data and it is consist of five steps

#### STEP 1: Define the problem questions
Based on the given problem always define a set of questions relating to the problems. Questions should be measurable, clear and concise. Design the questions to either qualify or disqualify potential solutions to your specific problem or opportunity. <br>
#### STEP 2: Collect Data
Based on the questions which were framed, determine what type of data is needed to be taken and analyzed<br>
#### STEP 3: Understand the data
In this step, we will clean the dataset by removing unnecessary columns, rows, missing values, outliers, combine two different datasets and more. This helps to take a new and clean dataset for the next step of analysis <br>
#### STEP 4: Analyse and Virtualize the data
In this step a deeper analysis is performed using concepts relaed to machine learning, text analysis and more. Virtulization data helps to give clear insights for the problem<br>
#### STEP 5: Interpret the results
Based on the analysed innformation it is important to interpret these data outcomes and provide a good insight to your employer
